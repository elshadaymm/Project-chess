# Java-Chess
An OOP based chess program written in the java programming language.  Created as a project for CPSC233 at the University of Calgary for the winter 2019 semester.

# How To Run
You must first run the complie.bat file to compile the code.  Thereafter the human_vs_human.bat/human_vs_computer.bat/ect file can be used to run the compiled game.

# How To Play
The GUI is currently text based in the command console.  Moves are made by inputing the the coordinate of the piece to be moved, and the coordinate of the square to be moved to.  Input is alphanumeric.  The console will printe all legal moves for the player to reference.  The game currently enforces basic rules and will score a win when a king is captured.  Check and checkmate are not yet programmed.
